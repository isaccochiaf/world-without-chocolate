            <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he countdown has started for chocolate lovers. Clocks are synchronized for the year 2020, when a possible lack of cocoa could embitter the palates of many, due to a dangerous combination of a demand increase and a supply decrease. News broke out at the end of 2014, when the results of a market trend analysis were released by the multinational company Barry Callebaut and picked up by several newspapers.
                <br> Is the future of cocoa so dark? According to Pamela Thornton, analyst of the cocoa market, “2020 has been a media construction; it is not a serious matter for those who work in this sector”. Nevertheless, she does admit some concerns about chocolate’s future. “The climatic phenomenon El Niño will take place this year and we will witness a substantial shortage of cocoa, probably of 250,000 tons, the highest in several years. The demand grows 2-2,5 % every year, especially in countries such as India and China”.
                <br> The future of this fruit is a puzzle between mysteries related to climate change and the arrival of El Niño to Ecuador, the increase of consumption in populous Asian countries such as India and the transition towards new models of production, which is already happening in Brazil.</p>

Ancient lands protected by the “Enchanted ones”, spirits of their ancestors reincarnated in centenary trees. She was born in this village, where she has lived for thirty-three years. She is a school teacher and spokesperson for the community, which lives on the production and sales of cocoa.</p>

                <p class="didascalia">Glicelia Jesus da Silva, leader of Tupinambá indigenous people, eats a cacao fruit in her village.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This fruit, along with the labour conditions and hard working days imposed to their employees was, precisely, what enabled the large estate owners’ enrichment at the southern area of Bahía. Brazil was the second world exporter until an act of bioterrorism destroyed the crops. Responsible was the Vassoura de Bruxa, also known as the witch-broom disease, this Amazonian fungus was introduced in the region in the late ‘80. The perpetrators of this act, which had a great social, economic and environmental impact, still remain a mystery for the justice. 90 % of the plantations were lost. More than 250,000 rural workers became unemployed, moved to the cities and built favelas. “Some former cacao farmers’ children now sell crack in the favelas”, declare Daniel Piotto, professor at Federal do Sul da Bahía University.
                    <br>
                    <br> Manuel Anastacio Leandro started to work with the cacao when he was fourteen year old. He is one of the workers who, after working over forty years in the plantations in the area, lost his job. It was right after the arrival of the witch-broom disease when he, his wife and his ten children had to leave to the South of Bahia’s economical centre, Ilheus City. Today, he still lives there, at Tedonio Villela neighbourhood and he has a cacao tree in his garden as a reminder of the past. This fruit not only left him without economical sustain but it also caused him a skin disorder because of the chemical products and herbicides they had to use at the plantations to control plant diseases.
                    <br>
                    <br>Nowadays, Brazil produces cocoa mainly to fulfill internal consumption. But, like a phoenix, it is rising from its ashes. “Crises aren’t always the end of the world. At present day, we can see the positive side of the Witch-broom disease” explains Gerson Marques, Executive Secretary of Cabruca Institute, organization specialized in development of cocoa production. "Social movements, indigenous people and family cooperatives had the opportunity to take over the cocoa production, occupying lands left by the indebted owners or buying them at a very low price. This is how the chocolate age began". Social Movements such as the Landless Workers' Movement, who occupied around nine hundred hectares of land in the Arataca area more than twenty years ago, have already launched their own organic chocolate called Terra Vista. Likewise, the cooperative of families, Embaúba, also produces its own brand. They don’t have bosses or landowner to control them. They now work in a self-organized way, taking care of their cocoa, from the tree to the chocolate bar.

                <p>A new chapter has begun for Glicélia and the Tupinambá community. With the arrival of the Witch-broom disease, they had the opportunity to get back their lands. The 'Enchanted ones' appeared in their dreams announcing them that the fight will start. These lands were expropriated from them by politicians of the region during the cacao boom at the beginning of the XX century, with the aim of selling them to future large estate owners. There are lands rich in lush vegetation and surrounded by rivers with wild animals such as jaguars and cobras. In 2010, the government circumscribed 47.376 hectares of the Tupinambá community, preliminary step towards the recognition of land ownership. Cacao is now the base of their economy, but has never stopped being the protagonist of their history. “We threw cacao pods as our only weapon against the police when they came with two helicopters, one hundred and eighty policemen and thirty three vehicles, to evict our village accusing us of hiding weapons. This was only one of the many attacks we had to encounter to defend our lands” related Glicélia, recalling this event which happened seven years ago, while the sun go down under the sierra and she touches her belly protecting her second child. “We’ve never belonged in another place” concludes the leader of the indigenous community, “No one will force us to leave this land and the cacao”.

A situation that keeps a large part of the Ecuadorian producers of cocoa wondering. Among them is Servio Pachard, fourth generation of cocoa producers, original from Manabí, located in the center - west of the country. In this centenary forests, where cacao trees coexists in harmony with papayas, avocados and several other tropical fruits, he produces the organic chocolate To'ak, considered by the magazine Forbes as the most expensive in the world; USD260 for 50 g. "El Niño is coming. The weather forecasts say that it will be something similar to that of 1997. It was the worst crisis that I have ever experienced. Sometimes, it was raining twenty-four hours non-stop, plants couldn’t survive the lack of sun. It was a very serious problem for the producers, it took us five to seven years to recover it all” he says.

                    According to the meteorologists of the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (INAMHI), El Niño will hit the country with rains twice above average, starting in December and it will continue throughout the first trimester of 2016. “2015 is one of the warmest years in history.” affirms Raúl Mejía, INAMHI coordinator, “And the climate change intensifies the natural extreme events worldwide, as El Niño. If in the next fifty years temperature rises two degrees more, the natural equilibrium will collapse”. It is forecasted that this phenomenon will affect cocoa production due to possible floods of the cultivated fields. Likewise, it could influence cocoa distribution as a result of waterlogged roads. The National Association of Cocoa Exporters in Ecuador, Anecacao, estimates that there could be a loss of 40,000 metric tonnes of cocoa.
                    <br>
                    <br> Extreme phenomena, such as El Niño, are not the only effects of the climate change that Manabí farmers have dealt with. This enemy, that has become part of the farmers’ daily routine, has also produced changes in temperature, altering seasons and causing important temperature variations after sunset. Cacao pods are dying at their early stages because of low temperatures at night”, explains Servio, “These temperatures also cause a microclimate that favours the spread of diseases”.
                    <br>
                    <br> While some cocoa producers don’t believe in the arrival of El Niño, others, like Servio and about half of the farmers of the region, have already prepared drainage channels to avoid floods and control humidity, which could lead to the spreading of diseases such as the witch-broom disease or la Monilla. Servio talks about this matter at the organization of which he is a member, la Red de guardianes de semillas, the seed guardians network. His duty consists on preserving the endangered native seeds. So far they have gathered more than two hundreds among fruits, leguminous and grains.
                    <br>
                    <br>“Since the time of my great grandparents, we have always grown national fine aroma cacao, the flavour of my childhood. It is a special variety recognizable for its sweet flavour, as it contains up to 17% of sucrose.” describes Servio as he opens a cacao pod to eat the pulp in its interior. “This variety is also threatened, since many prefer clones, different varieties of cacao grafts which give excellent results in volume and resistance to diseases, but not in quality. But here, people resist the idea of cultivating another type of cacao. After some tests we discovered 100% national cacao in our plantations, which we are multiplying to give it to the producers. This is our letter of presentation”

                <p>
                    <br> Further south of Manabí, in the surroundings of Guayaquil city, economical heart of Ecuador, there are the cultivators of the Union of Cocoa Farmer Organizations of Ecuador (UNOCACE). This entity gathers more than a thousand farmers from the region with organic certification. “We use clones of fine aroma cacao, grafts provided by the Ecuador National Investigation Institute of agriculture and livestock (INIAP), crossing the most disease-resistant varieties. We renew our plantations to ensure the future of cacao and prepare ourselves for a moment like this, with El Niño on its way.” states Freddy Cabello, UNOCACE’s manager. Working on the field the farmers wait for El Niño. A phenomenon that meteorologists announced more than a year ago when winds started blowing from the west to the South American coasts and that will soon unleash its force.

Such as Rekha Pawao, a young 24-year-old woman, from Navi Mumbai's suburbs, where 50,000 people live in huts, little houses of lamina or construction that are not bigger than five square meters. Usually she buys mini-packages of chocolate, in the kiosk next to the school, to give them to her daughters during holidays, portions of 10g. for five Rupias (0.07 Euros) which can be found in any stand in the city.

                    Her husband works in rock extraction and she teaches math, hindu and english to children between three and six years old. There are no chairs, tables or blackboard. Students sit all together on the floor of the little room while they listen to Rekha’s hindu, maths and english classes. “It is true that goods like chocolate for instance, do get here. However, the people that live in these slums, like these children’s families, only eat it during special occasions and celebrations. It is not an everyday thing for someone who has to ensure a daily meal.” explains Rajashree Nayak from the Arphen NGO who manages the school where Rekha teaches.
                    <br> Chocolate is a delight which is not affordable for everyone but which has captivated a significant part of India’s society. The consumption per capita has grown in the last five years from 50g. to 120g. Not so much compared with the nine kg per capita consumed by the swiss people but that multiplied for more than 1.200 billion inhabitants of India is equal to the weight of almost 30,000 Asian elephants. A trend that does not seem to be destined to revert. In 2019 it will increase 60%, according to the market research company Mintel. The greatest increase has been registered in the consumption of chocolates with surprises in the inside aimed for children, with a percentage of 30% last year, according to Euromonitor market research company. "In the last twenty years with the globalization, the way of life of the Indians has changed and their wages have increased, and a new system of values has developed between the respect to their traditions and the imitation of the Western world.” explains Pralhad Jogdand, professor of sociology at Mumbai’s University. “Chocolate means modernity, as we see in the advertising posters we find around Mumbai with Bollywood actresses as protagonists”

                    <br> In Colaba, Mumbai’s touristic neighbourhood, chocolate bars or patisseries have become a trend, where friends or families get together after meals to enjoy non-native pleasures such as pralines and cookies. This is the case of the famous Theobroma Patisserie, where 90% of the desserts are made with chocolate, preferred option of local palates. In between the cakes and the French inspired ‘pain au chocolat’, renowned chef Kainaz Messman sometimes experiments mixing chocolates with local flavours such as green cardamom, ginger and other spices. “Chocolate isn’t native to India. Before, it was just a sporadic pleasure. My generation has been the first to have free access to this good in the last thirty years.” says chef Messman of thirty-four years old, “Now, chocolate is substituting the typical Indian sweets as a gift in all festivities”.
                    <br>
                    <br>Not only consumers have joined this chocolate fever. Even Hindu deities loves chocolate, like Lord Murugan. Further south of Mumbai, in Allepey city, is Thekkan Pazhani Sree temple where devotees go to pay tribute to the god mornings and evenings. Here the most common offer are milk chocolate bars that devotees buy at the temple’s stand right at the entrance, for five rupees. In the little shop, the purple chocolate packages stand out between the colourful carnation and seed necklaces. This is the favourite offering between the students who want to ensure passing their exams successfully. “Nine years ago one student started this tradition that continued until today” says Syam, one member of the temple, showing some package of chocolate. From the youngest ones, such as six year old Anantha Krishnan, to Arya, a twenty year old university engineering student, everyone thinks chocolate can help them achieve good marks. They wait until the day before the exams to deposit the chocolates in front of the deity between the incense smoke and the unceasing mantras.
                    <br>
                    <br> Even Indian Ocean gods look towards the thickening clouds at the other side of the world with mistrust, where El Niño is on the verge of waking up risking the future of this fruit with which Indians have fallen in love, which makes Ecuadorians hold their breath and for which Glicélia and the Tupinambá community fight every day.
